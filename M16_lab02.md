This program creates a password with user specified length. Also the program needs input from the user specified characters, letters (upper and lower case)and digits.

All of the above features are implemented in the current state of the project.

There is a GUI and command line versions of the program that is executed at run time depending on the run commands from the terminal.The program runs and works in it's current condition. 
The GUI version consists of checkboxes and buttons and single line text with scrollbar. The user selects the max and min length for the password and specify the chareacters to be included in the password. Then user hits generate the password button and password appears in the textbox window.


One of the new features that is being sugguested is that improve the GUI version of the program. In its current version, the command line verison implements the generation of multiple passwords and writing them to a file. In order to improve the GUI one can add this feature to the program. 


Another suggestion to improve the prgram is that to add a way to store passwords securly and retrieve them according to the services they are being attached to. 

Te current condition of the README.md file is very informative.However, explanation for each class can be elaborated lilttle bit more. 

The BUILD.xml file has descriptions under the each target.

The .gitignore file can be modified that so that backup files wont be uploaded. We can add *~ to the .gitignore file. 

__Code related stuff:__
1) It looks like Symbols checkbox needs to be checked in order to add the special charactes to the password. Also if the even with the special character selected and the symbols checkbox is selected the program grenerates a password without the special character in the password.
