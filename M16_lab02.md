This program creates a password string by using the specified length from the user. Also the program gets the input from the user to include specified characters, letters (upper and lower case)and digits.

All of the above features are implemented in the current state of the project.

There is a GUI and command line versions of the program that can be executed at run time depending on the run commands from the terminal.The program runs and works in it's current condition. 
The GUI version consists of check-boxes, buttons and single line text with scrollbar. The user selects the max and min length for the password and specify the characters to be included in the password. Then user hits generate the password button and password appears in the text-box window.


One of the new features that was suggested is that to improve the GUI version of the program. In its current version, the command line version implements the generation of multiple passwords and writing them to a user specified directory. In order to improve the GUI, one can add this feature to the program. 


Another suggestion to improve the program was that to add a way to store passwords securely and retrieve them according to the services they are being attached to. 

The current condition of the README.md file is very informative.However, explanation for each class can be elaborated little bit more. 

The BUILD.xml file has descriptions under the each of the target.

The .gitignore file can be modified so that backup files won't be uploaded. We can add *~ to the .gitignore file. 

__Code related stuff:__
1) It looks like Symbols check-box needs to be checked in order to add the special characters to the password. Also when the special character selected and the symbols check-box is checked the program generates a password without the special character in the password. This can be added to one of the issues.
