Description
===========
This program contains a "backbone"/structure for a password (Password class),
a class that generates a String representing a password that meets the definition of a password specified in Password class (GeneratePassword class),
a GUI implementation to allow user interaction (PasswordGUI class)
Current User Stories
====================
User can specify what kind of password he/she wants, and the program will generate, randomly, a password base on those specification
Things a User can specify:
* The minimum length and maximum length of a password;

* What kind of characters (out of the 4) the password can have: UpperCase, LowerCase, Digits, Special Symbols)

* At least how many of each of these types he/she wants: say he/she can specify a password that must have at least 1 UpperCase, 2 Lowercase, 1 Digit

Does Software Run?
==================
Everything should run smoothly

Future addition/ User Stories
=============================
* Fix GUI to be more user friendly, activate the functionality to write to file(currently commented)

* add a way to store passwords securely and retrieve them according to the services they are being attached to, using a database.

* Another future improvement is turning it in to a android app.

#README Assesment
This is the 1st Version of this Code, so I give this README a perfect 100/100 since I wrote it
#Build.xml Assesment
We used Eclipse, the .ClassPath file is included in the github, highly recommend future people to continue using eclipse instead of running it remotely on CSIL and using ANT

#Current Issues
* Like we have mentioned, we included the GUI class as a courtesy to future people, didn't have time to work on it, so it needs to be cleaned 

Code related stuff:
===================
Just clean the code up in future: remove unnecessary and outdated code that are commented out
