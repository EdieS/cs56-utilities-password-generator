1. Issue: https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-utilities-password-generator/issues/27

* Right now, the password generator lets you specify which special characters you want to be included (omitting those you do not type). But what if the user only wants to include certain uppercase letters, or lowercase letters, or digits? Refactor the functionality of the program (for both the command line and GUI) to allow this functionality for ALL character types. Proposed point value: 200 pts


2. Issue: https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-utilities-password-generator/issues/31

* The way the character types are constructed is a bit weird. Also, in order to access a specific CharType, the programmer has to loop through the array of CharTypes to find what they want. Perhaps it is better to represent the array of all CharTypes with a set of key-value pairs? Proposed point value: 100 pts


3. Issue: https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-utilities-password-generator/issues/28

* JUnit testing is still limited. For ALL public functions, write a JUnit test in PasswordTest.java. Proposed point value: 50 pts


4. Issue: https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-utilities-password-generator/issues/29

* Fix the inheritance/class hierarchy to follow the MVC design pattern. The models are there and the views are there, but a controller needs to be added to keep those models and views separate (as opposed to what we have now). Proposed point value: 150 pts.


5. Issue: https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-utilities-password-generator/issues/30

* Despite generated passwords being effective when in use, it's hard to remember them by their very nature. Design a way to store passwords (securely!) so generated passwords can be retrieved along with what service they are being used for. For example, a user could to look up what generated password they used for gmail.com or github.com. Proposed point value: 500 pts
